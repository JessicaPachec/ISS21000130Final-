                        <p>As we know food insecuirty affects people's healths in unimaginable ways. But the people affected are closer than we think. Some experts may even say that there are key factors when it comes to people who suffer from food insecuirty such as race, ethnicty, income, employment, and disability.</p>
                        <p>According to a study done this year 2023 by Healthy People, about 28.6 of low income household sufferend from food insecuirty in comparasion to the nation average of 10.5%.</p>
                        <p>This study alone proves that there are a lot of people that go un seen when it comes to bot unemployment and food insecurity.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">hwo does food insecurity target people who are unemployed?</h2>
                        <p>Unemployment has an impact on houshold food insecurity because of their inability to be able to provide for basic needs. Low-income households that experience high unemployment are unable to pay bills, make hous payments, and much less pay for good and nutritious food.</p>
                        
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"35 million people in the U.S. are hungry or don't know where their next meal is going to come from, and 13 million of them are children if another country were doinf this to out children, we'd be at war." -Jeff Bridges</blockquote>
                        <p>So many of these people go unnoticed they suffer in silence, they know that there are people out there who want to solve world hunger but they don't know that there goal should start within the country first. We see many other countries going to war for thei children who are starving, but we can't even take the first step in giving back.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Diabled Elders and their struggle.</h2>
                        <p>Many of those who suffer from food insecurity also include disabled adults and elders. Many may have been born that way and no longer have anyone to take care of them which why the end up in awful situations. As a disabled person finding work is harder and their are also health expenses that they have to think about.</p>
