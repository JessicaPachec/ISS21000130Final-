                        <p>There are many organizations who are willing to help those who are in real need for not only food but also support whether it be physical mental or overall just someone to listen and talk to.</p>
                        <p>For mant people it can be a struggle and reach out for help because they have sense of pride that they need to keep.</p>
                        <p>But many organizations are really just there to help.There is not on single organization that helps out without the intentions of just truly being there for those who need it for example WHEAT is an organization in Arizona that makes it their mission to feed the people of Arizona with the most healthy and nutritious meal that they possibly can.</p>
                        <p>IIn Michigan there are organizations like Center for Civil justice, Focus:HOPE, and Food Bank Council of Michgan who are simply just there to help the increasing number of food insecurity and homelessness each year.</p>
                        <p>Please be sure each post has some closure. That is, the last paragraph should be memorable. If they remember nothing else from this page, what do you hope your viewer learned?</p>

                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/keyhands.jpeg" alt="this is a description of your image for accessibility" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
