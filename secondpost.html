                        <p>It is common to think that when someone is struggling with food resources, they are struggling with getting all their nutrients that they need. However, this is not the case. In many communities they are often called food desserts. </p>
                        <p> A food desert is a low income, low food access area where 20% of the population is below the poverty line. They found that on average there was not too much of a direct impact on income vs nutritional quality. Instead, more so focused on a variety of different factors. One major impact was their time management.</p>
                        <p> According to the study when interviewing candidates, they often knew that they were not meeting their requirements for nutrition but instead did not have the resources to change that. The most impactful idea to be is in this article people on SNAP or Supplemental Nutrition assistance program. Which even with that and their income could not meet the FDA’s nutritional guidelines. It makes a huge difference in their livelihoods. Because they found that the people with low food security often struggled with obesity and diabetes as well as other problems to their diet from bad food choices. These problems down the line can lead to worsening problems for the people struggling with it. 
</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the article talks about a societal change to make it more available to these people. They did not find a strong correlation between all these societal factors, instead that a mix of them can lead to differences in people's diets. There has to be resources and change to reduce the amount of food deserts in the United States and make getting these nutritional goals more available. </p>
                      
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Does food insecurity affect a certain minorit?</h2>
                        <p>This was a study that was done by Henry Ford to figure out if based on race there was an impact if they were getting their recommended nutritional goals. What they found was that on average non-hispanic blacks were often lacking on the more important nutritional goals, and instead were rating much higher in polyunsaturated fats. On average these people will struggle with creating  healthy meals and would instead get lower income meals that were more readily available. This is only increasing from 2013-14, making the polyunsaturated fats increase.</p>

                        <p>Another major trend to focus on is with fruits and vegetables. How it has remained unchanged and black Americans often struggle with this. This all comes back to a variety of different issues present in society that will make it harder for black Americans to start off to improve their lives. There are still the effects of redlining in today's world, and according to Socioeconomic factors associated with diet quality and meeting dietary guidelines… by Angela Leise and Patcia sharpe, they often found that black people predominantly were in food deserts more often. This makes it more difficult for them on top of their other issues they may face in home life. </p>
